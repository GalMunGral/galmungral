## the computationalist society: a manifesto

if you are reading this, you're witnessing and participating in a miraculous feat achieved only very recently in human history. written text is not built into language, but an unnatural technology -- language is based on sound, and recording the vibrations of our vocal cords as squiggles, then decoding them with our eyes, is not something we are born to do.

almost all humans who have ever lived were illiterate. for millennia, humans passed stories and wisdom from generation to generation verbally. only a few places invented written text independently, and only the privileged could wield this technology, a medium that externalizes our minds and lets them persist longer than ourselves, like a sarcophagus, granting a form of immortality. how insane it would have sounded if they were told that nowadays an average nobody can shame politicians and people in power for failing to spell or read properly. how far we have come as a civilization -- and all of that achieved in just the past century and a half!

what if this is just the beginning of something far greater, and we are nowhere near realizing our true potential as a species? what if we continue the effort to encourage ordinary people to distill, externalize, and preserve their mental processes? not just the utterance of words, but the formal, logical and mathematical thinking, and in particular, computational thinking.

"that's absurd," you might say. "very few could grasp such abstract concepts!"

and yet, consider how writing was once the exclusive domain of priests, scribes, and officials. programming today is treated in much the same way: programmers are cast as priests in the church of computation, a special class of people granted direct access to sacred knowledge, an indispensable medium for the rest of the populace.

"STEM!" they say. but i say: "let's do away with the priesthood!"

consider another kind of abstract symbols: sheet music. what is a 1/128 note? what is "sforzando piano"? and what even is c#7sus4(add13)? and yet, there is no corner of the world that humans have walked that does not hear music. we must distinguish between sheet music -- a technology for preserving and communicating music, and a european invention -- and the entirely separate, universal, innate human capacity to comprehend and create music.

we understand rhythm intimately: our hearts beat at a regular interval, we breathe, in, out, in, out, and we walk, left, right, left, right. computation is no different. it's also a kind of music within us, albeit a quieter kind. this is how you open a door: while your hand cannot reach the handle, repeat: left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot. if the door is locked, unlock it, then turn the handle. as a process that unfolds over time, computation permeates our existence, just like language and music. is it not possible that we are born with the brain wiring to think computationally, just as we are born with vocal cords and tongue muscles to make distinct sounds that carry meaning? and just as you don't need to be literate to be a good orator, and you don't need to read sheet music or recognize all the italian terms to be a good singer, you also don't need to parse american-english-inspired text filled with strange symbols to be a good computationalist. we are all born with the potential to be an orator, a musician, and a computationalist.

so what's to be done? 

first of all, our current approach to teaching programming, and more broadly, mathematics, is fundamentally flawed. you wouldn't teach a person who has never heard music before -- perhaps born deaf and just coming out of surgery that restored hearing -- by starting with sheet music notations. instead, you'd probably show them what sounds exist in the world, and how to make them by pressing a key, plucking a string, or blowing into a cavity. you'd let them compare pitches and timbres, and try to sequence and layer them. they'd be immediately intrigued, because the entire body and soul are engaged in the process.

perhaps the same applies to programming education. instead of teaching beginners commands, keywords, subroutines, classes, and all kinds of syntactic and semantic constructs, maybe we could start with a video game that provides an extremely simplified view of what's actually going on in a computer's circuitry, using a grid of registers where you can drag things around and combine them -- like crafting potions from ingredients in other video games. you could then record and play back what you've just performed, and further combine those recordings into richer, more interesting sequences -- like live looping, where you progressively add more elements: percussion, bass, strings, vocals. we could even extend the live looping metaphor to include recording and playing back the action of recording and playing back itself -- a meta-recording! in this way, we can introduce, simultaneously, at a lower abstraction level, registers and instructions, and at a higher level, recursion and composition. no symbols. no syntax. just the free flow of creativity. and then, once they are comfortable with this process, comes the final reveal:

"you have been programming this whole time!"

of course, this is just a crude idea, but the hope is to inspire you to imagine more ideas like this. i believe that once we break free from the conception of programming as a primarily symbolic, linguistic undertaking, the possibilities are limitless. the symbols, the syntax, the abstract constructs -- these remain our destination, the sheet music that crystallizes what we've composed. but first, we must learn to hear the sounds, and then to compose the music, so that we might have something worth preserving.

so why now, more than ever?

we are a fundamentally creative species waiting for a spark. silicon valley once brought us the promethean fire from the universities and national laboratories, but the fire has always been shielded from us in shiny crystal boxes, and today social media and generative ai -- creations by the high priests of computation, in the name of progress and democracy -- relentlessly strip us of that creative agency, reducing us from natural orators, musicians, and computationalists into idle, stupefied marvelers, observers, and consumers, paralyzed and unable to birth new things into the world. this is why we must sound the death knell of the priesthood of computation, especially now, in this age of disempowerment, when old ideals of rationality and optimism have given way to cynical, nihilistic paralysis.

so let's ask this question: what impact does actively engaging with computation -- not endlessly scrolling, watching, and prompting, but creating and composing through good old programming as both an introspective and externalizing process -- have on our inner mental world, or our very soul?

at this very moment, the music plays on in silence.

can you hear it?
